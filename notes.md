# Notes

Running notes for the project.

## TODO

- set up a basic working apollo server using hardcoded json data
  - test with playground
- set up schema and query resolver
- get mongo connection running with mongoose
  - add schema to mongo/mongoose and enforce on db write
- add mutation to server
- figure out where to run it so I can add stuff from wherever (would my pi be able to handle it?)
- figure out how to handle linked terms
