# Notes

Running notes for the project.

## TODO

- ~~set up a basic working apollo server using hardcoded json data~~
  - ~~test with playground~~
- ~~set up schema and query resolver for actual api~~
- get mongo connection running with mongoose
  - add schema to mongo/mongoose and enforce on db write
  - atlas has a "free forever" option; I should just use that so I don't have to worry about what machine the server is running from
- add mutation to server
- figure out where to run it so I can add stuff from wherever (would my pi be able to handle it?)
- figure out how to handle linked terms
